      <description>Introduction Software engineering is the systematic process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications to meet user requirements. To effectively communicate and understand complex software systems, software engineers rely on a variety of diagrams. These visual representations serve as blueprints, aiding in design, development, and overall project comprehension.
Understanding Common Software Engineering Diagrams Software engineering diagrams can be categorized based on their purpose. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore some of the most commonly used diagram types.</description>

      <description>I am an open source software developer who love solving problems and everything open source. I am interested in everything STEAM(Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, &amp;amp; Mathematics).
I studied Electrical/Electronic Engineering Technology from Delta State Polytechnic, Ozoro, Nigeria(now known as Delta State University of Science and Technology). I am pursing a Computer Science degree from University of the People(UoPeople) which is a US distance learning school as part-time study along with MIT OpenCourseWare resources.</description>
