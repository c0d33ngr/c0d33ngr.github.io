![my picture](stewie_small.jpg)

I am an open source software developer who love solving problems and everything open source. I am interested in everything STEAM(Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, & Mathematics).


I studied Electrical/Electronic Engineering Technology, a two year programme from Delta State Polytechnic, Ozoro, Nigeria(now known as Delta State University of Science and Technology).
I am pursing a Computer Science degree from University of the People(UoPeople) which is a US distance learning school as part-time study along with other MOOC platforms like Coursera, Udacity and MIT OpenCourseWare resources.

I am currently looking for job opportunities, freelance gigs or collaborations.

I am certified in:

* [AI Fundamentals](https://www.datacamp.com/skill-verification/AIF0025779916184)
* [Data Literacy](https://www.datacamp.com/skill-verification/DL0039179656230)

My hobbies are simulations, electronics and robotics, reading, watching TV, journaling, and many more.
